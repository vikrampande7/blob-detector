"# blob-detector" 
This project was a part of course NCSU ECE 558: Digital Imaging Systems.
- A Laplacian Blob Detector was implemented from scratch.
-  Algorithm Outline:   
   - Generated Laplacian of Gaussian filter.
   - Generated Laplacian Scale Space with Convolution.
   - Performed Non-Max-Suppression.
   - Drawn circles around maxima points.
